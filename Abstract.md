### ****How Decentralized is DeFi? Searching for Centralization Within Decentralized Exchange Protocols****

With the central bank raising interest rates in hopes to lower inflation, consumers are facing the imminent threat of lower wages, less spending, and higher unemployment rates, along with the possible risk of driving the entire economy into recession. Centralization in our global financial system exposes critical flaws including lack of trust, entry barriers, financial censorship, and global inequality. DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, is a smart contract and blockchain mediated financial system aiming to solve these problems by providing peer-to-peer financial services.However, there are increasing concerns for centralization existing within each DeFi protocol. The project features an analysis of the most popular liquidity pool based Decentralized Exchange protocols, examining factors that potentially contribute to centralization. It has been concluded that no Decentralized Exchange protocol is completely decentralized, meaning there exists at least one component containing a degree of centralization. The conclusions drawn from this investigation will capture the full granularity of decentralization within prominent protocols in the DeFi ecosystem.
