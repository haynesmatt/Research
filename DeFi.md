ðŸ’¡ Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a **movement** aiming to create a **new financial system** that is **open to everyone** & **does not require trusting intermediaries (permissionless)**

</aside>

### What does DeFi rely heavily on?

- Smart Contracts
    - **building blocks** of DeFi
    - contains all the **logic**
- Cryptography
- Blockchain

### Branches of DeFi

- Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
- Stable coins
- Lending and borrowing
    - MakerDAO
        - First platform on DeFi, did they make the first algorithmic stable coin (DAI)?
        - Non-algorithmic stable coins are centralized, they have people responsible for balancing the price
    - Compound
        - Largest lending and borrowing platform
        - $630 Million locked in the protocol
        - An algorithmic autonomous protocol, make interest by supplying coins
    - Aave
- Insurance
- Margin Trading
- Derivatives

### Pros of DeFi

- Permissionless
- Open
- Censorship resistant
- Cheaper
- Built on blockchain

### Cons of DeFi

- Smart contract bugs & protocol changes (that change the way the smart contract behaves)
- How decentralized a project is?
    - How easily can it be shut down
- Systemic risk
    - If asset prices sharply decline, might result in liquidation across lots of DeFi protocols
- Network Fees & congestion
    - Especially if you want to avoid liquidation
    - Eth 2.0 will help
