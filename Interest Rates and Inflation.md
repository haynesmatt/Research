## Notes

- Interest rates are raised by central banks, with the motive to control inflation.
    - Rising interest rates make the cost of borrowing go up
- What are the impacts of these raised interest rates
    - Sink consumer confidence
    - Result in fewer jobs, lower wages, cause stock prices to fall
    - **if they go too far too fast, it can tip economies into recession**
    - more expensive mortgages
    - more expensive to borrow and invest
        - less economic activity
        - fewer jobs created
        - less money for households
- What is an interest rate?
    - the rate you pay for the premium when borrowing something
        - want the interest rate as low as possible so you donâ€™t have to pay that much back
        - earning more on your savings means a high interest rate would be ideal
- No one set interest rate - thousands of banks set their own commercial rates
    - influenced by the interest rate that the central bank sets
- What is a central bank?
    - a bank for banks
    - banks earn interest when they leave money with the central bank
- What are reserves?
    - Money on hand that commercial banks have, used to lend to other commercial banks at an interest rates
    - Can deposit their excess reserves to the central bank

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Central banks (the Fed, Bank of England, European Central Bank) are all trying to hit an inflation target of 2%. Interest rates are a powerful tool they have to do this

</aside>

- If inflation is seen as too high, thatâ€™s when banks raise interest rates to people
    - this change spreads throughout the financial system and slows down rate of inflation

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Higher interest rates directly linked to less consumer cash to spend, which means households will spend less, less spending means businesses will be warier of raising prices, which should lower inflation

</aside>

- It is impossible to get inflation under control, **without severely denting economic activity**
    - A little inflation is **okay,** it keeps the economy moving at a sensible speed
        - inflation staying high for too long is a problem
        - higher prices will mean higher wages needed, creating an upward spiral
- Why do central banks raise interest rates?
- Central bankers are really concerned about setting expectations of inflation
    - if it can show it is credible (will always act to get inflation down to 2%), then maybe wonâ€™t have to raise and lower interest rates into a see-saw
- Raising interest rates can slow the economy right down
    - brake pedal has a delay
    - can take 2 years to see the full results
        - trying to read the road ahead
