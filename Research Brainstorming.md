# Research Brainstorming

## **Research Question?**

- Research into Liquidity Pools of Decentralized Crypto
    - What is liquidity **independent examples**
        - examples references pictures
    - how can you work with them?
    - how can you make money out of it?
    - mit technology reviews **in UB Libraries** free - Look for liquidity
        - April 2022 June 2022
    - v2 and v3 liquidity pools
- How centralized is decentralized finance (DeFi)?
    - what features make a financial system to be successful, strong and/or decentralized?
        - list features of key aspects of a strong, secure, safe, cost-friendly, etc. financial system
        - compare the current financial system (banks and whatnot) and DeFi (a term for the very niche crypto people) with my requirements to **“see if they pass the test”**
            - breaking down the DeFi ecosystem
            - breaking down the banking system
        - maybe even propose my own idea of a financial system at the end, a system (based of my requirements) even better than DeFi and the current financial system
    - DeFi is a very niche term. In reality, crypto isn’t needed for a decentralized financial system
        - all you need is non-centralized control, which comes with proper verification, transparency…
        - if something were to backfire, authority would be needed to make sure things don’t go crazy - or at least a secure system to stop operation if something backfires
            - ex. since governance can essentially influence / update how a smart contract operates, what if the smart contract doesn’t operate the way intended… that’s a systematic problem… who has the emergency lever to stop / fix this???
    - DeFi is associated with crypto I because it’s built on blockchain, whether Ethereum, Polkadot, Algorand, etc.
        - Blockchain technology is just the best infrastructure out there right now to create these decentralized things
            - if there were other ways that made it easier to create a decentralized platform than blockchain, then it would make no difference
        - it all comes down to the fact that blockchain technology opens new doors in solving problems that weren’t able to be solved before
    - Bitcoin is built on blockchain. More people know about bitcoin than blockchain.
        - What sticks with people / what they care about / what they only know about is
            - **crypto**: wealth-building, new way to invest, get-rich-quick, are what resonates with people
            - **way more than** the potential life-changing use cases of **blockchain technology** itself.
    - With the light of things right now
        - Exchanges like Celsius and Binance not allowing people to withdraw their crypto (they are centralized exchanges)
            - People are confused, don’t understand that they are centralized and what power they have, and this scares them off.. because the intent and whole motive is to have freedom and no control
        - “You don’t own ‘Web3’. The VCs and LPs do. It will never escape their incentives. It’s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label.
