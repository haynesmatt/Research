[What are Smart Contracts in Crypto? (4 Examples + Animated)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyaIppMhuic)

- What is a smart contract?
    - A piece of code that does something ********if something else happensâ€¦ if this, then that
- What is Solidity?
    - A programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum Network
- Examples of how smart contracts can be used
    - Swap different types of tokens

        ðŸ’¡ Maybe I can create my own swap smart contract

    - Reward upon reaching a certain goal
    - Insure **if something bad happensâ€¦ yes!
        
        Letâ€™s break this down: farmer John gets paid $100000 if temp > 95 for 5 days in a row
        
        - How do you know the temperature?
            - With oracles
            - What are oracles?
                - A trusted source that gives real world info to a smart contract
        - How do you get the money
            - Also Individually? or With crowdfundersâ€¦ a group of people that get together and chip in the money
        - What happens to the $100,000 throughout the duration of the smart contract?
            - It gets locked up within the smart contract for the whole duration
                - If condition is met, the $100000 gets released to John
                - Else, the money gets paid back to the investors (plus the premium)
    - Crowdfund â€¦ meaning if a smart contract address reaches *x* amount of ether, then it can be distributed equally to the members who donated it
    - Possibilities are **endless**
    - Flash loan
        - Can borrow any amount of money as long as it gets paid back instantly
- Two key elements of smart contracts
    - **IMMUTABLE** - canâ€™t be changed
        - If there is a bug, will need to create a new smart contract and just tell people to use the new one
    - **NO DISCREPENCIES**
        - In essence, it is an **agreement** that can **automatically executed** if certain conditions are met
        - A smart contract is a piece of code that is designed to remove human error and issues
    - **DISTRIBUTED**
        - The code is on a bunch of computers around the world, in fact **anyone** can see your smart contract and see how you participated in it
